# Command Line Games using Javascript
As part of one of my graduate workshops, I created three games that anyone can play on their command line. The code for the games are present in this repository. Here's what you need to do to run the file:

1) Download the cmdgames.js file
2) Ensure you've got Node JS installed on your computer
3) Open command line and navigate to the directory of the file in step 1
4) Type "node cmdgames.js" and press enter
5) Enjoy!
